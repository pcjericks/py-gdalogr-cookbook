Welcome to the Python GDAL/OGR Cookbook!
========================================

This cookbook has simple code snippets on how to use the Python GDAL/OGR API.  The web site
is a project at `GitHub <https://github.com/pcjericks/py-gdalogr-cookbook>`_ and served by Github Pages.  If you find missing recipes or mistakes 
in existing recipes please add an issue to the `issue tracker <https://github.com/pcjericks/py-gdalogr-cookbook/issues?state=open>`_.

We heavily relied on Chris Garrard's excellent `Geoprocessing with Python using Open Source GIS <http://www.gis.usu.edu/~chrisg/python/2009/>`_
and the official `GDAL/OGR Python documentation <http://gdal.org/python/>`_.
