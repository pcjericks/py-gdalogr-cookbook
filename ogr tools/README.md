OGR Tools
========

The code in this repo is intended to demonstrate how one could utilize the OGR (vector) library within GDAL 
for performing basic geoprocessing tasks. It serves merely as an example to help others learn the 
GDAL library, for which instructional resources for beginners are scarce, and is by no means exhaustive.
